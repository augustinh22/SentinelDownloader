### Super basic setup

The plugin files **SentinelDownloader** should be copied into:
  **...\\.qgis2\\python\\plugins\\SentinelDownloader**

The first time it needs to be manually recognized in QGIS by changing
the QGIS plugin settings to inlcude experimental plugins.

If making changes, install the other experimental plugin called 'Plugin Reloader'
so that you do not have to restart QGIS every time a change is made.

_Note:_
_It is still pretty buggy, especially when it comes to any sort of error handling._
