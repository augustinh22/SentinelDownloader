### Notes

The user interface needs to be re-structured.

This plugin works for QGIS 2.x

_It is still pretty buggy, especially when it comes to any sort of error handling._

### Super basic setup

The plugin files **SentinelDownloader** should be copied into:
  **...\\.qgis2\\python\\plugins\\SentinelDownloader**

The first time it needs to be manually recognized in QGIS by changing
the QGIS plugin settings to _inlcude experimental plugins_.

If making changes, install the other experimental plugin called 'Plugin Reloader'
so that you do not have to restart QGIS every time a change is made.
